# Bookify
Web development project made my Kristiana and Andrew for Web Development II. The project uses NodeJS for the back-end integration and React for the front-end. 

# Project Idea
The purpose of Bookify is to provide an online platform for users to explore, purchase, and read books convenietly. We based this project off of Kindle/Apple Books. Bookify will have a user-friendly interface that encourages user to browse books, search/discovery, user registration, shopping cart and checkout, and users should be able to manage their profile. The target audience for Bookify include book lovers of all age groups who prefer browsing and purchasing books online or individuals who enjoy exploring a range of genres. Book browsing and searching, user registration, and shopping cart and checkout are some of Bookify's functionality. We are also hoping to implement a personalized recommendations to users based on their reading history and preference. Say you liked reading 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', then Bookify would recommend a novel similar.  It could be The Chamber of Secrets or something entirely different.
